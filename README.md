# Machine Learning by Andrew Ng on Coursera
This repository contains my completed exercises, implemented in python and documented as Jupyter notebooks. These notebooks, which 
contain many interactive visualizations generated using the [Plotly library](https://plot.ly/), are 
best viewed using the nbviewer at https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/kohaugustine/Machine-Learning-Coursera/tree/master/.
