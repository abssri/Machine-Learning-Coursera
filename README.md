# Machine Learning by Andrew Ng on Coursera
This repository contains my completed exercises for the machine learning course, documented as Jupyter notebooks. These notebooks, which 
contain many interactive visualizations generated using the [Plotly library](https://plot.ly/), are 
best viewed using the nbviewer at https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/kohaugustine/Machine-Learning-Coursera/tree/master/.
